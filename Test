**Subject:** Meeting Invite: Discussion on Cisco NSO Service Naming Issue  

**Body:**  
Dear Team,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to address a critical issue in our current Cisco NSO implementation that requires immediate attention.  

### **Issue Summary**  
We currently have five predefined services with static names in our Cisco NSO setup. All configurations are being applied under these five service names, leading to the following risks:  
1. **Global Impact of Deletion:** Deleting any service removes configurations across all devices associated with it.  
2. **Operational Inefficiencies:** Managing and debugging configurations becomes increasingly challenging due to the lack of unique service identifiers.  
3. **Scalability Challenges:** This static naming approach restricts our ability to scale and introduce new services efficiently.  

### **Objective of the Meeting**  
We aim to:  
1. Discuss the risks and limitations of the current implementation.  
2. Explore Cisco's recommendations and best practices for dynamic or unique service naming.  
3. Identify actionable steps to remediate the issue and ensure long-term scalability and resilience.
