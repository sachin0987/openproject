To implement a `sync-from` feature using the kicker in Cisco NSO to periodically check the synchronization status of devices, you will need to set up a kicker policy that triggers the `sync-from` action at specified intervals. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### Step 1: Define the Kicker Policy
Create a kicker policy that specifies the trigger condition and the action to be taken. For periodic checks, you can use a time-based trigger.

1. **Create a Kicker Policy File**:
   Define the kicker policy in a file, usually in JSON or XML format. Here’s an example in XML:

   ```xml
   <kicker>
       <name>periodic-sync</name>
       <when>
           <cron>
               <expression>0 * * * * *</expression> <!-- Run every minute -->
           </cron>
       </when>
       <action>
           <type>script</type>
           <name>sync-from-script</name>
       </action>
   </kicker>
   ```

   The above example sets the kicker to trigger every minute. Adjust the cron expression to set the desired interval (e.g., hourly, daily).

### Step 2: Create the Sync-from Script
The script specified in the kicker policy should perform the `sync-from` action on the devices.

1. **Create a Script File**:
   Write a script that NSO can execute. Here’s an example in Python:

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   import ncs
   import ncs.maapi
   import ncs.maagic

   with ncs.maapi.single_write_trans('admin', 'python') as trans:
       root = ncs.maagic.get_root(trans)
       for device in root.devices.device:
           try:
               print(f"Syncing from device: {device.name}")
               device.sync_from()
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"Failed to sync from device {device.name}: {e}")
       trans.apply()
   ```

   This script iterates over all devices and performs a `sync-from` operation. Save this script in the appropriate scripts directory of your NSO installation.

### Step 3: Register the Kicker and Script in NSO
You need to register the kicker and the script within NSO so that it can be executed according to the defined schedule.

1. **Register the Kicker**:
   Ensure that the kicker policy file is placed in the correct location (typically `$NCS_DIR/load-dir`). Then, load the kicker configuration into NSO.

   ```bash
   ncs_load -lm <path-to-kicker-policy-file>
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   Ensure the script has executable permissions.

   ```bash
   chmod +x <path-to-sync-from-script>
   ```

### Step 4: Verify and Test
1. **Check Kicker Registration**:
   Verify that the kicker is registered correctly in NSO.

   ```bash
   ncs_cli -u admin -C
   show kicker
   ```

2. **Test the Kicker**:
   Manually trigger the kicker to ensure it performs the `sync-from` action as expected.

   ```bash
   request kicker periodic-sync run
   ```

### Maintenance and Monitoring
Regularly monitor the kicker logs to ensure it operates correctly and addresses any synchronization issues. Adjust the kicker policy or script as needed based on operational requirements.

By following these steps, you’ll have a kicker in Cisco NSO that periodically checks the synchronization status of your devices, helping maintain consistency between NSO and the actual network device configurations.
