Here is the full write-up for all sections, including Risk and Controls, Culture and Values, and Manager Effectiveness, with constructive feedback:

Risk and Controls

Vasihna Priya is proactive when it comes to identifying risks within the team. She is quick to spot potential issues and escalate them, which has helped avoid bigger problems before they impact the team’s work. For instance, there have been several occasions where she caught compliance risks early, and her quick action allowed us to address them before they became serious. This attention to detail is critical in managing our work effectively.

She also does more than just follow the rules—she ensures that the team operates in a way that respects the broader principles of our firm’s policies. This balance between strict compliance and ethical behavior is valuable in creating a strong culture of integrity.

Additionally, she maintains a strong working relationship with control function colleagues, ensuring that any concerns about regulations or policies are addressed effectively. However, I think she could improve by taking a more active role in educating the team on these control functions. By creating more opportunities for the team to engage with control functions, she could help us all better understand the firm’s compliance requirements.

Culture and Values

Vasihna consistently takes accountability for her responsibilities and encourages the team to do the same. When there are challenges, she steps up and ensures that things are handled in a timely and professional manner. This approach sets a strong example for the team and reinforces a culture of ownership.

She promotes an inclusive work environment, making sure everyone feels heard and valued. This open and supportive atmosphere allows team members to share their thoughts without hesitation, fostering a collaborative team spirit. However, I believe she could do more in terms of promoting local initiatives at the global level. Being the local manager, she is in a unique position to highlight the successes of our team to the broader firm. If she actively advocates for local efforts on a global scale, it would bring more visibility to the team’s contributions.

Additionally, while she treats everyone with respect and upholds the firm’s values, there’s an opportunity for her to focus on encouraging more cross-team collaboration. Engaging with other teams more frequently and facilitating interactions between the local and global teams would strengthen our partnerships across regions.

Manager Effectiveness

Vasihna empowers me to make decisions and take ownership of my work. She trusts the team to manage tasks independently, which has boosted my confidence in handling responsibilities. Her feedback is also clear and actionable, making it easier to improve based on her insights. One example of this is when she provided detailed input on a recent project, which helped me correct my approach and improve the outcome.

That said, I feel there’s room for improvement in how frequently feedback is provided. While the feedback she gives is helpful, having more regular one-on-one sessions would give me more consistent guidance. This would help address smaller concerns before they escalate and ensure continuous growth.

She is supportive when it comes to personal well-being, ensuring that I can balance work with personal commitments. However, I think she could enhance her effectiveness by taking on more responsibility for the local team. By being a stronger advocate for the team’s needs, especially when communicating with senior leaders, she could help us better align our work with broader firm goals and ensure that the team’s challenges and achievements are recognized.

Lastly, while Vasihna does a good job of sharing information from senior leadership, providing more context on how global decisions affect our specific work would help us stay aligned with the overall strategy. More transparency about how broader goals tie into our day-to-day tasks would be beneficial.

This complete write-up should provide a balanced mix of positive feedback and areas for improvement, keeping the tone constructive and professional. Let me know if you’d like any further changes!
