Here’s a simpler and more conversational version:

Next year, I want to improve my coding skills and learn more about solution architecture.

For coding, I plan to take on some programming challenges and contribute to open-source projects. This will help me become a better coder and learn from others.

I also want to focus on solution architecture by studying how to design systems that work well together. I’ll look at examples of successful projects to understand what makes them effective. Additionally, I want to get familiar with AI and machine learning, especially large language models (LLMs), so I can use these technologies in my designs. This will help me create better solutions that incorporate the latest advancements.

Let me know if you’d like any changes!
