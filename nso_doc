Yes, I can help with this! Below is an outline and content for a document explaining the implications of having NSO service instances per device versus a common service instance for all devices.

Cisco NSO Service Instance Design: Device-Wise vs. Common Instance

1. Overview

Cisco NSO allows service configurations to be applied across devices using service instances. This document outlines the two main approaches to service instance design and their implications:
	•	Device-Wise Service Instance: Each device gets its own unique service instance.
	•	Common Service Instance for All Devices: A single service instance applies to multiple devices.

2. Device-Wise Service Instance

Description

In this approach, each device has a separate service instance. Each instance is uniquely identified and independently managed.

Advantages
	1.	Granular Control: Individual devices can be updated, modified, or removed without impacting other devices.
	2.	Reduced Risk: Errors or deletions in one instance affect only the associated device, minimizing the blast radius.
	3.	Custom Configurations: Allows device-specific configurations tailored to individual requirements.
	4.	Simplified Troubleshooting: Easier to debug issues since the scope is limited to a single device.

Disadvantages
	1.	Increased Service Count: Managing a large number of service instances can be complex and may strain the NSO system with high-scale deployments.
	2.	Operational Overhead: Each new device requires creating and managing a unique service instance, increasing operational tasks.

3. Common Service Instance for All Devices

Description

In this approach, one service instance is used for all devices. Configuration changes apply globally to all devices under that instance.

Advantages
	1.	Simplified Management: Only one service instance to manage, reducing administrative overhead.
	2.	Scalability: Easier to handle large-scale networks since the number of service instances is minimal.
	3.	Consistency: Ensures all devices are configured identically, reducing configuration drift.

Disadvantages
	1.	Higher Risk: A misconfiguration or deletion affects all devices under the instance, which can lead to widespread outages.
	2.	Limited Flexibility: Device-specific configurations are harder to achieve.
	3.	Troubleshooting Complexity: Debugging issues becomes challenging because changes impact multiple devices simultaneously.

4. Key Implications

Aspect	Device-Wise Service Instance	Common Service Instance
Granularity	High	Low
Risk of Failure	Isolated to individual devices	High impact across all devices
Flexibility	High (supports device-specific configurations)	Low (requires uniform configurations)
Scalability	Challenging in large deployments	Easier to scale
Troubleshooting	Easier to isolate issues	Difficult due to global impact
Administrative Overhead	High	Low

5. Recommendation

Best Practice
	•	Use Device-Wise Service Instances for critical infrastructure or scenarios requiring granular control and custom configurations.
	•	Use a Common Service Instance for homogeneous environments where devices share identical configurations and changes are minimal.

Hybrid Approach
	•	For networks with diverse requirements, consider a hybrid model:
	•	Device-Wise instances for critical or unique devices.
	•	Common instance for less critical or uniform devices.

6. Risks in Current Implementation

If all devices are managed under a common service instance, the following risks arise:
	1.	Global Impact of Deletions: Deleting the service removes configurations from all associated devices.
	2.	Unintended Changes: A mistake in configuration affects all devices.
	3.	Maintenance Complexity: Temporary changes for a specific device may require workarounds.

7. Conclusion

Selecting the appropriate service instance design depends on the network’s scale, criticality, and configuration requirements. While device-wise instances provide flexibility and safety, they require more management effort. On the other hand, a common instance simplifies operations but comes with increased risks.

8. Next Steps
	1.	Review the current service instance structure.
	2.	Arrange a call with Cisco representatives to discuss best practices.
	3.	Conduct a risk analysis of moving to a device-wise model or adopting a hybrid approach.
	4.	Plan for any required migration or remediation.
