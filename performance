### Strengths:
- **Technical Expertise**: Tamas’s performance during the WAN 2.0 project was outstanding, particularly in his deep knowledge of Cisco NSO tooling and ISE. He played a key role in resolving complex technical challenges and was quick to provide support when needed. His understanding of ENS-related tools also made him the go-to person for many tasks, which had a direct impact on the project’s overall success.

- **Collaboration and Support**: Tamas has consistently shown strong collaboration skills, especially in testing and pre-provisioning tasks. His willingness to assist at any time ensured we could stay on track with the project timeline. His readiness to step in when things got tough had a positive effect on team morale and efficiency.

- **API Development and Integration**: His contributions to writing APIs for Cisco NSO and Cisco Crosswork were instrumental to the project. By ensuring smooth integration and development, Tamas added significant value to our deliverables, which had a clear impact on the quality and speed of our work.

### Constructive Feedback:
- **Proactive Communication**: While Tamas is always responsive and helpful when approached, being a bit more proactive in communicating potential issues or sharing updates would take his performance to the next level. This would help preempt some challenges and improve team coordination even further.

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Tamas’s depth of expertise is impressive, and I think he could have an even greater impact by sharing his knowledge with the wider team. Whether through informal knowledge-sharing sessions or mentoring, it would help others benefit from his skill set and make the entire team stronger.

### Performance and Impact:
- Tamas has had a significant impact on the success of WAN 2.0. His technical skills, especially in Cisco NSO and ISE, combined with his collaborative nature, have made him a crucial contributor to the project’s success. His consistent performance in solving problems and supporting the team has directly influenced the positive outcomes we’ve achieved. With a bit more focus on proactive communication and sharing his expertise more widely, Tamas has the potential to elevate his role even further and make an even greater impact on future projects.
